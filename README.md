# Berry-With-Score

The full rules for Berry can be found [here](https://move38.com/pages/berry).

While I believe learning the 4 scoring positions only takes a couple of play throughs to understand and remember, I thought it would be a fun exercise to let the Blinks remind you how much each formation is worth.

The following sketch does a couple of things that y'all might appreciate:
1. When a color is in a scoring formation, it blinks dark, the number of times for the score achieved.
2. The hinting for the next color inline is in sync (In the published version of the game, I thought the varied nature of this was actually more beautiful)
3. Removed the hinting for locked pieces because there is already so much information being communicated.

This might be a nice way for beginners to start out playing Berry. Let me know if you like this version better, or feel free to use pieces of the code such as finding the formation of the Blinks.
